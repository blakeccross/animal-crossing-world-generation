# Animal Crossing-Style World Generation

This repository showcases a procedurally generated world inspired by Animal Crossing: Wild World, featuring a curved terrain, tile-based map generation, and player interaction with the environment.

Features

## Curved World

A dynamic, curved world asset designed to mimic the iconic rolling landscape style of Animal Crossing.

Smooth player transitions as they traverse the environment.

## Tile-Based Map Generation

Worlds are generated using a grid of acres:

Each acre is a 4x4 or customizable tile layout.

Acre types include rivers, forests, plains, and custom biome support.

Rivers can snake through multiple acres, creating dynamic and visually appealing landscapes.

## Wave Function Collapse Algorithm

Generates coherent, connected tiles while maintaining variety.

Supports tile-based rules for environmental consistency (e.g., rivers must flow into adjacent tiles).

## Interactive Gameplay

Player character can walk and experience the curved terrain.
